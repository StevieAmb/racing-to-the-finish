# Racing To The Finish

How long would it take someone to get to one of the tips Bermuda Triangle from Rhode Island? Since you're here, I know you are one of the inquiring minds, and this app can tell you average time in minutes it has taken different sailors to get there.

Why in minutes?

Where will you find sailors to put in this information into the app for you, if you don't happen to be one?

I can answer the first question, but not the second. Some mysteries are meant to be unsolved...

Answer: I take it you've seen this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-r2xXtSsPV0). 
Well, if we believe Johnathan Larson, and there are 525,600 minutes in a year, you can use the app to find out what percentage of the year it'll take you to sail from Rhode Island to one of the points of the Bermuda triangle. Specifically Bermuda.

I still can't help you about the sailors. That quest is your own...

## OVERVIEW
Racing To The Finish is a coding challenge meant to stretch the minds of the people who have the opportunity to complete it. It is the s/hero's quest, where one is armed with naught but React.js, CSS, Cypress, GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration, and semantic HTML. With out weapons of choice, we build an app that allows a user to input the time of day they ended a race, and on what day of the race on which they ended it. Because most people are a fan of RENT and musicals, the app returns the average time it takes to sail to a tip of the Bermuda Triangle from Rhode Island in minutes. 

Below are some screenshots showing off the features of the Not Furgotten Website:  
Welcome to the app!

You can see change, just like that! 

Wanna the average time (in minutes)?

In due time, just gotta submit it!


## FUTURE FEATURES
In the future, I would want to:
- Add a delete feature to the submitted user input time, so that if you insert a time that's not accurate, you can delete it if you don't want it as part of the avaerage.
- Make the application mobile responsive.
